## Chat 0: Project Setup & Planning (Pre-Development)
**Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Duration:** Extended planning session  
**Phase:** Project Initialization

### ✅ Major Accomplishments
- **TaskMaster Integration:** Successfully configured with Google Gemini models (2.5 Pro main, 2.0 Flash fallback)

- **Task Organization:** Reordered tasks into logical development flow with proper dependencies
- **Complexity Analysis:** Analyzed and expanded high-complexity tasks to ensure realistic implementation scope
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Updated all project documentation to reflect current tech stack and approach

### 🔧 Key Implementation Decisions
1. **Tech Stack Finalized:** React 18 + TypeScript, Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL + PostGIS
2. **No External Map Dependencies:** Custom SVG renderer instead of Mapbox for cost efficiency
3. **Mobile-First Approach:** Optimized for one-hand operation while walking
4. **Chat Organization Strategy:** 5 feature-based chats instead of 39 individual task chats
5. **TaskMaster as Primary PM Tool:** All task tracking through MCP integration
