### üîß Key Implementation Decisions

1. **ESLint v9 Migration:** Updated to new `eslint.config.js` format (breaking change from v8)
2. **Path Aliases Strategy:** Used TypeScript path mapping with `tsconfig-paths` for runtime resolution
3. **Workspace Structure:** Separated packages (shared libraries) from apps (deployable applications)
4. **Development Scripts:** Parallel dev server execution using `pnpm -r --parallel dev`
5. **PowerShell Integration:** All commands now use PowerShell for consistent Windows environment

```

### üìù Chat Organization Strategy Revision

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY:** Task 1 alone required substantial time and context. The original plan of 5 chats covering 39 tasks is unrealistic. **Each task should have its own dedicated chat** to avoid context overflow and maintain focus.

**Revised Strategy:**
- **Chat 1:** Task 1 (Complete) ‚úÖ
- **Chat 2:** Task 2 - Docker Environment  
- **Chat 3:** Task 3 - Environment Configuration
- **Chat 4:** Task 4 - Database Connection/ORM
- **Chat 5:** Task 5 - Database Schema Design
- **Chat 6:** Task 6 - Sample Data & Seeding
- **Chat 7:** Task 7 - A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- And so on...

This allows for:
- Proper depth and attention to each task
- Better problem-solving without context limits
- More detailed documentation per task
- Easier debugging and iteration

## Frontend Progress Logging Strategy

**NEW APPROACH** for Tasks 9-39 (Frontend & Final Integration):

1. **Frontend-Specific Log:** Create `.taskmaster/docs/frontend-progress-log.md` for Tasks 9-39
2. **Structured Sections:** Organize by major development phases:
   - **Phase 1:** Core Frontend Setup (Tasks 9-12)
   - **Phase 2:** Navigation UI & Functionality (Tasks 13-18) 
   - **Phase 3:** Map Integration & Multi-Floor Logic (Tasks 19-21)
   - **Phase 4:** Search & Advanced Features (Tasks 22-23)
   - **Phase 5:** Accessibility & Performance (Tasks 24-25)
   - **Phase 6:** Testing & Deployment (Tasks 26-39)

3. **Cross-Reference System:** Maintain links between backend and frontend logs
4. **Git Integration:** Use separate commit patterns for frontend vs backend changes

**Implementation:** Starting with Task 9, create the new frontend log and reference this file for backend context.
