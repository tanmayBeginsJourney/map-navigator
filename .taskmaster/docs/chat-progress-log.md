### üîß Key Implementation Decisions

1. **ESLint v9 Migration:** Updated to new `eslint.config.js` format (breaking change from v8)
2. **Path Aliases Strategy:** Used TypeScript path mapping with `tsconfig-paths` for runtime resolution
3. **Workspace Structure:** Separated packages (shared libraries) from apps (deployable applications)
4. **Development Scripts:** Parallel dev server execution using `pnpm -r --parallel dev`
5. **PowerShell Compatibility:** Used semicolons instead of `&&` for command chaining

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

```

### üìù Chat Organization Strategy Revision

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY:** Task 1 alone required substantial time and context. The original plan of 5 chats covering 39 tasks is unrealistic. **Each task should have its own dedicated chat** to avoid context overflow and maintain focus.

**Revised Strategy:**
- **Chat 1:** Task 1 (Complete) ‚úÖ
- **Chat 2:** Task 2 - Docker Environment  
- **Chat 3:** Task 3 - Environment Configuration
- **Chat 4:** Task 4 - Database Connection/ORM
- **Chat 5:** Task 5 - Database Schema Design
- **Chat 6:** Task 6 - Sample Data & Seeding
- **Chat 7:** Task 7 - A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- And so on...

This allows for:
- Proper depth and attention to each task
- Better problem-solving without context limits
- More detailed documentation per task
- Easier debugging and iteration
