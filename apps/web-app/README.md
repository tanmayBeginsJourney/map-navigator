## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management with three main stores:

### UI Store (`useUiStore`)
- Loading states (general, navigation, route calculation)
- Error handling (UI errors, navigation errors)
- Mobile UI controls (sidebar, fullscreen, QR scanner)
- Toast notifications with auto-hide functionality

### Map Store (`useMapStore`)
- Building and floor plan selection
- Viewport management (center, zoom, rotation)
- Interactive elements (selected nodes, highlighted paths)
- Touch gesture support for mobile devices

### Navigation Store (`useNavigationStore`)
- Current location and destination tracking
- Route calculation and segment management
- User location with accuracy tracking
- QR code scanning context
- Navigation history and favorites
- Emergency mode and evacuation routes

## Logging

The application implements structured logging following backend patterns:

```typescript
import logger from '../utils/logger';

// Basic logging
logger.info('Navigation started');

// With context
logger.info({ startNodeId: 123, endNodeId: 456 }, 'Route calculation requested');
```

### Log Levels
- `fatal`: Application crashes
- `error`: Error conditions
- `warn`: Warning conditions (emergency mode, errors)
- `info`: General information (navigation events)
- `debug`: Detailed debugging (state changes)
- `trace`: Very detailed debugging (hover events)

See [LOGGING.md](./LOGGING.md) for complete documentation.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for local development:

```bash
# Logging level (fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# API endpoint (when backend integration is added)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript configuration with:
- Strict type checking enabled
- No unused locals/parameters
- No fallthrough cases in switch statements
- Explicit type annotations required

## Testing

### Store Testing

Use the built-in `StoreTestComponent` to test store functionality:

1. Navigate to the home page
2. The test component demonstrates all store operations
3. Interactive buttons test state changes
4. Console logs show structured logging output

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Reset all stores to initial state
import { resetAllStores } from './store';
await resetAllStores();

# Initialize stores with logging
import { initializeStores } from './store';
await initializeStores();
```

## Build and Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates optimized production build in `dist/`:
- Minified JavaScript (~222KB gzipped)
- Optimized CSS (~1.4KB gzipped)
- Static assets with cache-friendly names

### Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel with `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- All code must pass TypeScript type checking
- ESLint rules must be followed
- Structured logging should be used instead of console.log
- State changes should include appropriate logging context

### State Management Patterns

- Use selectors for optimized re-renders
- Include structured logging for debugging
- Follow the established store patterns
- Maintain type safety throughout

### Performance Considerations

- Zustand stores are optimized for minimal re-renders
- Logging checks levels before processing
- Production builds exclude debug-level logs
- Touch interactions are optimized for mobile

## Contributing

1. Follow the established TypeScript and ESLint configurations
2. Add appropriate logging for new features
3. Update documentation for significant changes
4. Test store functionality with the test component
5. Ensure all builds pass before committing
